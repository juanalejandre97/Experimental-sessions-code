# Experimental-sessions-code
Experimental sessions code of the subject TE II of 4th year of Physics Bachelor in University of Seville.

I have gathered here the code concerned with the resolutions of many tasks associated to different techniques:

- Linear and non-linear regressions 
- Curves and distributions fitting 
- Data processing
- Experimental data measurement calculations
- Data representation

I hope this material can be useful for some another students or interested data analyst involved with physics and data analysis.
